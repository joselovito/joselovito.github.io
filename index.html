I then added some subtle stereo widening combined with making the subs (below 68Hz) mono, and some DXP multi-band compression, which only compresses below a certain threshold. the final touch was driving the clipped and limiter a bit to inch out some more volume (always preserving transients!!).</span>

                <span class="comments">this track had an audibly large crest factor (19.1dB!), and so the main task was to reduce this in order to bring up everything apart from the kick and snare, while keeping their transients intact. the final crest factor was 15.8dB, achieved with a combination of pentode harmonics and saturation, master tape compression, parallel multi-band compression and limiting. I also added some tube EQ to bring up the trumpets a touch, some low fq saturation to enhance the 808, and some soft harmonic excitement.</span>

                <span class="comments">'the moment i knew' was already relatively loud and had a healthy crest factor. the main challenge was to control the low end bass and kick, which were quite loud. with a combination of low-end mono-making, 15ips tape machine emulation, and multi-band compression, a thick and tight low-end was made possible (might be inaudible on small speakers, but try on headphones or monitors). once that was achieved, the rest of the mastering was only some very gentle tone balancing, and safeguard limiting.</span>

                    <br><br>my process is unique to each track, and sometimes all it needs is a final check on loudness before being ready for release! however, it is important that an <strong>independent set of ears</strong> check the dynamic range, tonal balance, and loudness of your track before release.</span>

                <span class="loud-text">confused about loudness? there is a lot of misinformation online about loudness targets in mastering and streaming platforms. some will tell you -14 LUFS, other -16LUFS, some talk about -1dbTP…
                    <br><br>the (sad?) truth is that in the professional mastering world, engineers don't care about the LUFS value. what matters is <strong>dynamic range</strong>, which is the relationship between the peak loudness (e.g. the sound of a kick) and the average loudness (e.g. the continuous piano harmony) - this value is also called <strong>the crest factor</strong>. mastering engineers will treat a track in order to achieve a competitive crest factor while preserving transients and dynamic range. check for yourselves on Spotify!</span>
